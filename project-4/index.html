		<h3 id="tina">Tina Arnold (My Wife)</h3>
		<p>My wife and I have been married for 14 years and now have four wonderful children. Although we have had some rought spots in our marriage, our love for each other has always overcome the darkness. I have had her full support in every decision that I have made, whether good or bad and I, the same for her.</p>

		<h3 id="candm">Clara and Marian Arnold</h3>
		<p>Clara and Marian are my two oldest daughters. Clara is 11 and Marian is 10. Marian was born 13 months after Clara. Together, they can usually made a room feel like World War 3 with all of the fighting that they do. At the end of the day they are best of friends. They love each other very much they just have a hard time showing it sometimes.</p>

		<h3 id="kat">Kathryn Arnold</h3>
		<p>Kathryn, or Kat as well call her, is our spazzy child. She's 5 years old and pitches fits beyond any child I have ever seen, but on the end of the spectrum, she is the most generous and loving child I have ever known. She is beautiful and brilliant in all aspects.</p>

		<h3 id="aiden">Aiden Arnold</h3>
		<p>Aiden is my little buddy. He's my 2 year old son and he is a major hand full. He is into everything, he never listens, and he hits his sisters constantly. Other the hand he is very loving and playful and so, so full of life.</p>
